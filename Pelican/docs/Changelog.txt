## [0.2.1] - 2016-7-18
### Changed
- The SSL certificate expired so I issued a new SSL certificate and recompiled the iPXE binary.
- The iPXE binary was not recognizing the SSL certificate so I dug through the iPXE code and found that giving the nginx IP address as the “common name” field with allow it to pass.  Changes were reflected in the user manual.
- wrote a “deployCloud” script that checks the status of each of the servers and then initiates the deployment process.  Along with the latest copy of the VM, this dramatically decreases necessary configuration time.
- Identified a key networking issue where a router may block DHCP requests preventing it from working.  A warning was written in the “Troubleshooting Deployment” section of the user manual.
- New sections were added to the user manual to resolve some of the ambiguities.  Older sections were edited to fix basic spelling and grammatical errors.
